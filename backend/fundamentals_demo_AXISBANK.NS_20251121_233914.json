  "summary": "Axis Bank's recent dip appears to be more related to company-specific activities such as stake sales and market reactions to these decisions rather than broad macro or sector downturns. The company's earnings remain resilient, with a strong Q4 net profit and improvements in asset quality. Management guidance appears stable, with no recent negative news or key management exits. Technically, the stock is near a support zone which may provide a floor. It is important to monitor upcoming news about stake sales, sector performance and overall market trends.",
